# Airline Operations gRPC Platform (ASP.NET Core) ✈️

A practical, step-by-step tutorial series where we build a **real-world gRPC API** in **ASP.NET Core** using an airline operations domain.

You’ll learn **from zero gRPC knowledge to a working, evolvable gRPC platform**, with clean contracts, realistic entities, and patterns you can reuse in production.

> ✅ Best for developers who already understand REST / API development, but **haven’t worked with gRPC** (or haven’t integrated it into ASP.NET Core before).

## 🧩 Series theme

### **“Airline Operations gRPC Platform”**

We’ll build a small set of gRPC services around:

* Flights
* Airports
* Aircraft
* Passengers
* Bookings
* Check-in
* Boarding
* Notifications

Each episode adds a realistic layer (contracts, versioning, architecture patterns, and “real-world” behavior).

## ✅ What you get in this repository

* A **complete working solution**
* **Separate Git branches per episode** so you can:

  * follow along from scratch, or
  * jump to any episode instantly
* A clean **Domain ↔ Contracts (proto) ↔ API mapping** approach
* A demo client to call services and verify behavior

> 💡 Tip: Check the branch list to move episode-by-episode.

## 🧠 How to use this repo (recommended flow)

1. Start on the **Episode 1 branch**
2. Watch the matching video
3. Compare your code with the branch at the end of the episode
4. Move to Episode 2, and so on

## 📌 Notes

* This repo is designed to be used as a **learning playground**.
* The focus is on **practical implementation**, not just theory:
  contracts, mapping, real entities, and patterns you’ll actually use.
